The purpose of the "Philosophers" project is to effectively learn the
concept of multithreading using threads. Assigning a task to multiple
threads will yield faster results. However, in scenarios where these
threads are not used correctly, the results may not be accurate. In this
project, one of the values taken as an argument specifies the number of
philosophers, which determines the amount of threads opened. The
goal is to ensure that the threads opened work correctly using Mutex
and other auxiliary elements.
